# FireChat
FireChat: App made as part of an Udemy Course to train/learn MVVM, programmatic UI, Firestore.  

I follow the course in an active state, meaning:  

• I try as much as I can to challenge myself by writing the code before watching the tutorial.  
• I modify some of the code from the course to match concept and best practice learned before.
